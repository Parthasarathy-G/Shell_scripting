What is Shell?

A shell is a special user program that provides an interface for the user to use operating system services. 
Shell accepts human-readable commands from users and converts them into something which the kernel can understand. 
It is a command language interpreter that executes commands read from input devices such as keyboards or from files. 
The shell gets started when the user logs in or starts the terminal.


Shell is broadly classified into two categories –

Command Line Shell
Graphical shell

There are several shells are available for Linux systems like –

BASH (Bourne Again SHell) – It is the most widely used shell in Linux systems. It is used as default login shell in Linux systems and in macOS.

KSH (Korn SHell) – The Korn Shell was also the base for the POSIX Shell standard specifications etc.
